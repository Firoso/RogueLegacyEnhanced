# Rogue Legacy Enhanced

This project is supposed to add modability and features to the original game engine.

In current state, it is just raw and fixed source. It is compilable and launchable, but definitely not playable right now.

I started cleaning it, then I'll start to fix bugs, etc. and after that, I'll start expanding the project with ability to mod it. 

To make it work, copy these files from game folder to lib folder:
DS2DEngine.dll
InputSystem.dll
SpriteSystem.dll
Tweener.dll

Also, put all game files to your Debug and Release folders after first compile, if you want to use just-in-time debugging.

Feel free to contribute to this project :)
