# Rogue Legacy Enhanced

This project is supposed to add modability and features to the original game engine.

In current state, it is just raw and fixed source. It is compilable and launchable, but definitely not playable right now.

I asked for devs permission to post the actual source here, so crossing fingers.

If this project gets green, I'll post my work here :)
